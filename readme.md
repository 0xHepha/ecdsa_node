# ECDSA Node

## Initial Code

This project is an extension of the `Alchemy University Week 1 project`. The initial code manages a simple server/client structure to check balances on different accounts to achieve a minimum simulation of a blockchain node.

For more info, check: [Alchemy University ECDSA Node GitHub repo](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/ecdsa-node)

## New Features

This repo extends and upgrades the base code to make it more interesting and useful. The main added features are:

#### 1) Change of library

All code related to the signature creation, recovery, etc. is changed from the [ethereum-cryptography](https://github.com/ethereum/js-ethereum-cryptography) library to the [noble@1.7.1](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-secp256k1/tree/1.7.1) due to:

üîÑ**April 2023 update**: ethereum-cryptography v2.0 is out, switching [noble-secp256k1](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-secp256k1) to [noble-curves](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-curves), which changes re-exported API of secp256k1 submodule.

#### 2) Web client side:

-   Updated the interface to check balances on different accounts by using a standard Ethereum address format.

-   New interface to send transactions.

    -   Transactions can be sent by using the public address if the used address is one of the provided to increase a faster user experience.
    -   The transaction can be sent to any address by providing the public address and the amount to send.

-   Info label with standard addresses to use for testing.

#### 3) Server side:

-   A new script to generate private keys, public keys, and addresses.
-   Update of `app.post('send')` call
    -   Checks the signature of the transaction to see if the sender is the owner of the account.
    -   Adds a message format for the hashed message (`sentAmount + ":" + receiverAddress`) to prepare for future implementations of calldata.
    -   For further info on changes in the API calls structure check [Server](#Server) section

## Client

The client folder contains a [React app](https://reactjs.org/) using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). To get started, follow these steps:

1. Open up a terminal in the `/client` folder
2. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the application
4. Now you should be able to visit the app at http://127.0.0.1:5173/

## Server

The server folder contains a Node.js server using [Express](https://expressjs.com/). To run the server, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal within the `/server` folder
2. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
3. Run `node index` to start the server

The application should connect to the default server port (3042) automatically!

_Hint_ - Use [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) instead of `node` to automatically restart the server on any changes.

### API calls to the server

API calls to the server can be done using other client interfaces or just plain command line calls. They only need to follow the structure of the data object.

#### `app.post('send', [object])`

‚ö†Ô∏èThis call is used to send a transaction to the node. This call sends an amount from one account to another. The data object should have the following structure **order**:

```json
{
    "sender": "0x5asca...5123", // String
    "sign": [], // <Uint8Array> signature of hash(amount + ":" + receiver)
    "recoveryBit": 0, // Number: recovery bit from signature
    "recipient": "0xn3w...6AF", // String
    "amount": "..." // Number: amount to send
}
```

#### `app.get("/balance/:[address])"`

Returns the balance of the address provied in the call

### Runnng the scripts

To generate a **new private key**, public key and address run the following command in the server folder:

    node scripts/generate.js
